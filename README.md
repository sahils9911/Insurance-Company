These Power BI dashboards together tell the story of an insurance company's policy performance, customer demographics, claim distribution, and profitability across geographies, policy types, and channels. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the visualizations and metrics shown in each dashboard.[1][2][3]
Geographic and Policy Overview
•	The world maps show where insurance policies are active, inactive, paid, denied, or pending around the globe, making clear which continents and regions have high policy density and activity.[3][1]
•	Policy status filters and legends (Active, Inactive, Denied, Paid, Pending) allow users to compare geographic spread and current outcome of claims efficiently.[1][3]
Claims and Profit Analysis
•	The bar charts display counts of claims paid out versus denied for various policy types (health, home, travel, and vehicle insurance), revealing patterns in acceptance rates and types of insurance with more approved claims.[1]
•	Profitability gauges show the number of profitable policies and average profit per policy, giving a quick view of corporate success metrics.[1]
•	Another key metric shown is the average premium paid, total premium collected, and the loss ratio (claims divided by premium), which illustrates how sustainable and profitable each policy type is.[2]
Customer Demographics
•	Pie and donut charts visualize customer age distributions by gender, providing an overview of the gender split among policyholders and helping identify demographic trends (49% male, 51% female, for example).[1]
•	Additional breakdowns by channel (Broker, Agent, Direct Sales, Online) reveal how policies are sold across different business models and the effectiveness of each sales channel.[2]
Policy Details and Status
•	The total number of policies, aggregate policy worth (4 million), average claim processing days (11), and claim outcomes (Denied, Paid, Pending) deliver a summary of operational scale and efficiency.[3][2]
•	Detailed bar charts at the bottom of the third dashboard show policy status outcomes grouped by type, allowing deeper analysis of specific insurance types and the status of their claims.[3]
Investment and Secure Amount
•	The sum of secure amount (insured value) by policy type is shown in a pie chart, describing the risk exposure and portfolio allocation of the insurer.[2]
•	Stacked bar charts compare profit and capital invested by policy type, providing visibility into which insurance lines deliver the best returns relative to investment.[2]
 
In summary, these dashboards deliver an integrated story of:
•	Where insurance policies are active, pending, paid, or denied worldwide.
•	Which policy types are most profitable and widely adopted.
•	How claims are processed and distributed across types.
•	What channels and demographics drive policy sales.
•	How company-wide metrics on premium, profit, loss ratio, and investment interact to shape business performance.[3][2][1]
This holistic view helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions about sales focus, policy pricing, risk management, and geographic expansion.
